It was first used for a group called [*TeamToilettesBio*](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamToilettesBio). Now, the aim is to make it universal.\n\nThanks to some members of those Discord servers: [*discord.js*](https://discord.gg/bRCvFy9), [*The Coding Den*](https://discordapp.com/invite/code*), [*Programming Discussion*](http://invite.progdisc.club) and [*Zeste de Savoir*](https://zestedesavoir.com) for the technical help.\n I also want to thank [*BelleChoucroute*](https://twitter.com/Clo_Stylinson) for the wise advice she gives me and the official plastic duck used for tests known under the name [*Horsengel*](https://twitter.com/Horsengel).",
